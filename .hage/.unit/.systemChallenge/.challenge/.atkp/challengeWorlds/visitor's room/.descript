Welcome to the S.E.E. visitor's room! This is a semi-experimental simulation of a semi-real institute via complex electronics that you probably wouldn't understand and that will not be explained. If you are disatisfied in any way with the services of S.E.E, get over it! We really don't care. Anyway, try not to make to much of a mess in here, because its supposed to look somewhat clean. Sincerely, S.E.E. welcoming program.

Large portable type room. Old desks with a few papers. Lots of broken down printers and computers. Reception desk with a loudspeaker welded onto it. One computer with a flickering screen thrown into the corner. Old wooden door labeled shade library, steel tunnel with railings and path to path spire, grassy trail leading into the distance blocked off by a large iron gate, a steel vault door labelled employees only, and a old wooden door labelled the road of redundance.
